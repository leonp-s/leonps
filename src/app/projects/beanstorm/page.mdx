## Introduction

### The Goal

For a while now, a number of existing and new espresso machines have been
offering features to enable precise control of pressure/flow, temperature,
profiles and graph; in real-time, shot characteristics. These features are
increasingly becoming desired and expected in the `specialty` coffee scene. The
Decent DE1, Meticulous and Gaggiuino have all served as significant inspiration
to the project. All of which facilitate pressure profiles, real-time graphing,
and temperature control.

### Starting Point

The starting point for the project is an unmodified Rancillio Silvia from 2012,
a clean slate to work from. The Rancillio Silvia is essentially a glorified
kettle, and that's why it's great. All the mechanical components to build a
great, capable espresso machine, without the software. The Silvia has no digital
control electronics, using thermal fuses for temperature control and a switch
wired directly to the vibratory pump to get the shot started. Vibratory pumps
are really effective for the size, they are also quite cheap but tend to be
quite loud. Both the Decent DE1 and Gaggiuino projects achieve pressure control
using vibratory pumps. For the Gaggiuino an in-line pressure transducer is used
to create the pressure control loop.

## Mechanics

In order to achieve a much quieter sound when the machine is pulling a shot, the
vibratory pump has been switched out for the Fluid OTech GA072. This is a DC
rotary vane pump that is used in lager, commercial, multi group-head espresso
machines and really has no place in a home machine like the Silvia.
Nevertheless, I managed to pick one up on eBay for about Â£80.00, and so I
thought I would give it a shot. This introduced a number of challenges, both
from an electronics standpoint (i.e. how can I power and control a 24V DC motor
in a small UK mains powered espresso machine) and also from a plumbing
perspective. These pumps are powerful, providing a flow-rate far too high for
conventional espresso.

To overcome the issue of flow rate, a bypass circuit is needed to essentially
drop the flow rate such that you have control for a range of RPMs. I found these
two threads super useful and explain in more detail the problems with
controlling flow/pressure with rotary vane pumps,
[convert-to-rotary-pump](https://www.home-barista.com/repairs/convert-to-rotary-pump-stepper-motor-t87534-20.html),
[pressure-profiling-with-fluid-o-tech](https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/pressure-profiling-with-fluid-o-tech-tmfr-pump-or-wholesale-copying-greg-scaces-ideas-t12179.html).

These threads suggested drilling the regulator valve in the pump to create the
bypass (this sounded scary and I don't have access to a milling machine to get
through the steel valve). However, I have used an external bypass circuit across
the inlet and outlet of the pump with a variable needle valve in between that
allows me to tune the flow rate to the effective RPM range of the pump. I havexw
manually tunes the machine using the valve, however I would consider graphing
pressure against pump RPM with a blanking disk in place to tune this more
accurately.

## Electronics

Please do not rely on any of this build information, dealing with mains power
can be very dangerous, this post is in no way intended as advice.

This espresso mod removes entirely all original wiring of the machine to build a
new custom harness incorporating a hefty 240VAC - 24VDC converter, DC motor
speed controller, 40A SSR for temperature control of the boiler and mechanical
relay for switching the 3-way-valve in the group head. Alongside this, the
machine is controlled with an ESP32 S3 microcontroller an inline pressure
transducer (for pressure control) and thermocouple, connected to the boiler (for
temperature control).
