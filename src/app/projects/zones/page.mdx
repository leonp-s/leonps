# Zones Convolution - Spaces On Demand

Zones convolution allows users to find and share impulse responses captured in great sounding and unique spaces.
Inspired by the [Open Air library](https://www.openair.hosted.york.ac.uk) and the popular [Altiverb](https://www.audioease.com/altiverb/) plugin,
Zones extends their capabilities by providing; a simple, intuitive interface to tag, categorise and upload IRs,
and a VST/AU plugin to search and convolve these IRs directly in the box!

{/* The online interface and plugin will both become available for free upon release. */}

This article aims to showcase some of the features, design and implementation detail of the platform in it's current state.

As we've grown, we've seen how Preline has helped companies such as Spotify, Microsoft, Airbnb, Facebook, and Intercom bring their designers closer together to create amazing things. We've also learned that when the culture of sharing is brought in earlier, the better teams adapt and communicate with one another."

> To say that switching to Preline has been life-changing is an understatement. My business has tripled and I got my life back.
