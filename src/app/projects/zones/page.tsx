          Small teams and individual designers need a space where they can watch
          the design process unfold, both for themselves and for the people they
          work with â€“ no matter if its a fellow designer, product manager,
          developer or client. Preline allows you to invite more people into the
          process, creating a central place for conversation around design. As
          those teams grow, transparency and collaboration becomes integrated in
          how they communicate and work together.
